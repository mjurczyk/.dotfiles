# Editorconfig

Editorconfig shared between IDEs/editors.

Works mostly on `.js` files, appends new line at the end of the file, cleans up unnecessary whitespace.

Assumes `UTF-8` as the one and only charset.

## Usage

* Place config in the project folder
* (If necessary) Install plugin for the editor (ex. Brackets EditorConfig)
